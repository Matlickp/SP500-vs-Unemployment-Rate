Market Data vs Unemployment Rate

For this project we wanted to look at two relationships that relate to market data and the unemployment  
rate in the United Statesover time. The first is the correlation between the S&P500 (SPY) and the
Volatility Index(^VIX). The second is the between the overall movement of the market, using SPY and ^VIX,
compared to the overall unemployment rate. For this analysis we used the past 19 years from 1/1/2000 to 
12/31/2018 in order to take advantage of 2 large market downturns and their recoveries. Being able to see how the 
Volatility Index affects the S&P500 and how that in turn affects the unemloyment rate could help predict any future spikes
in unemployment and allow government and private organizations to be proactive in preparing for the needs that will come.
